TRANSFER REQUESTIf you want to transfer
to a division of the company in another city, you should write a job transfer application letter to your Departmental
Head or Human Resources expressing your reasons.Employees may seek a transfer:



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to undertake professional development (e.g.
learn new skills or a new line of business)•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to confront new challenges (e.g. you have mastered all the duties related to your current position
which has now become routine and you feel the need for a change)



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to break away from unrelenting tension or
conflict within a team



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to cope with a change in life’s circumstances (e.g. family illness,
marriage, divorce, birth of a child)



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to recover from illness or manage the aging process (e.g. physical pain, fatigue) – in this instance, you may want to request reduced
working hours or lighter duties



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to change the nature of your job (e.g. from
on-the-road to a non-travelling role)



•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to repatriate (i.e. return to country of origin)A job transfer request
made for personal
reasons should state those reasons
clearly and succinctly.
However, you should also highlight
your achievements, strengths and abilities, draw attention to your familiarity
with the organization’s values and
practices, and demonstrate how the company will benefit from the transfer. If appropriate, include a transition plan, which includes
training a new person for your
current job.&nbsp;

The job transfer
request letter should be written
in formal business
format with a polite and respectful
tone. The employee should keep copies
of all communications concerning the transfer request.Note that, if you want to apply
for an existing, advertised vacancy
within the company, you should fill in
the application document, write a cover letter,
and treat it as you would an external application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15
